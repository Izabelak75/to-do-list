## Description
This is a simple ToDo List web application. You can add tasks, mark them as done, and delete them. The design follows BEM conventions, and the interface includes green checkboxes and red trash icons for task management.

## Functionality
- Add a new task using the input field and the "Add Task" button.
- Mark tasks as done by clicking the green checkbox (task gets a checkmark and is crossed out).
- Delete tasks by clicking the red trash icon.
- Tasks are dynamically added to the list, and the layout is responsive.
